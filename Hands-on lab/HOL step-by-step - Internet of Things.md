# Internet of Things hands-on lab step-by-step

If you have not yet completed the steps to set up your environment in [Before the hands-on lab setup guide](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Internet%20of%20Things.md), you will need to do that before proceeding.

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

## Overview

Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. Their **You-Left-The-Light-On** service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Diagram of the preferred solution described in the next paragraph.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png 'Preferred high-level architecture')

Smart Meters are installed in buildings. They will register with a Device Provisioning Service using an attestation method through an enrollment group. Once registered and connected, messages are ingested from the Smart Meters via the IoT Hub that the Device Provisioning Service assigned to the device. A Stream Analytics job pulls telemetry messages from IoT Hub and sends the messages to two different destinations. There are two Stream Analytics jobs, one that retrieves all messages and sends them to Blob Storage (the cold path), and another that selects out only the important events needed for reporting in real time (the hot path). Data entering the hot path will be reported on using Power BI visualizations and reports. For the cold path, Azure Databricks can be used to apply the batch computation needed for the reports at scale.

Other alternatives for processing of the ingested telemetry would be to use an HDInsight Storm cluster, a WebJob running the EventProcessorHost in place of Stream Analytics, or HDInsight running with Spark streaming. Depending on the type of message filtering being conducted for hot and cold stream separation, IoT Hub Message Routing might also be used, but this has the limitation that messages follow a single path, so with the current implementation, it would not be possible to send all messages to the cold path, while simultaneously sending some of the same messages into the hot path. An important limitation to keep in mind for Stream Analytics is that it is very restrictive on the format of the input data it can process: the payload must be UTF8 encoded JSON, UTF8 encoded CSV (fields delimited by commas, spaces, tabs, or vertical pipes), or AVRO, and it must be well-formed. If any devices transmitting telemetry cannot generate output in these formats (e.g., because they are legacy devices), or their output can be not well formed at times, then alternatives that can better deal with these situations should be investigated. Additionally, any custom code or logic cannot be embedded with Stream Analytics---if greater extensibility is required, the alternatives should be considered.

> **Note**: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2019 or later
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio)
- A running Azure Databricks cluster (see [Before the hands-on lab](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Internet%20of%20Things.md))

## Exercise 1: IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service deployment

Duration: 30 minutes

In your architecture design session with Fabrikam, it was agreed upon to use Azure Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to manage automatic device registration. The DPS would then assign an IoT Hub to the device that ingests telemetry from the Smart Meter Simulator. In this exercise, you will deploy an IoT Hub and DPS to enable device registration and connectivity.

### Task 1: Provision the IoT Hub

In these steps, you will provision an instance of IoT Hub.

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource** in the navigation pane, enter `IoT Hub` into the **Search the Marketplace** box, and select **IoT Hub** from the results.

   !["IoT Hub" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box. IoT Hub is highlighted in the search results.](./media/create-resource-iot-hub.png 'Create an IoT Hub')

2. On the resource overview page, select **Create**.

3. On the **IoT Hub** screen, **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group**: Choose Use existing and select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.

   ![Screenshot of the Deployment succeeded message, with the Go to resource button highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-deployment-succeeded.png 'Deployment succeeded message')

7. From the **IoT Hub's Overview** blade, select **Shared access policies** under **Settings** on the left-hand menu.

   ![Screenshot of the Overview blade, settings section. Under Settings, Shared access policies is highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies.png 'Overview blade, settings section')

8. Select **iothubowner** policy.

   ![The Azure portal is shown with the iothubowner selected.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies-iothubowner.png 'IoT Hub Owner shared access policy')

9. In the **iothubowner** blade, select the **Copy** button to the right of the **Connection string - primary key** field. Record this value for a future task.

   ![Screenshot of the iothubowner blade. The connection string - primary key field is highlighted.](./media/iot-hub-shared-access-policies-iothubowner-blade.png 'iothubowner blade')

### Task 2: Deploy the Device Provisioning Service

In these steps, you will deploy an instance of the Device Provisioning Service (DPS).

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource** in the navigation pane, enter `IOT Hub Device Provisioning Service` into the **Search the Marketplace** box, and select **IoT Hub** from the results.

    ![The Search the Marketplace textbox is shown with IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service entered as the search criteria and is selected from the search results.](media/dps_marketplace_search.png "Search the Marketplace")

2. On the resource overview page, select **Create**.

3. On the IoT Hub device provisioning service **Basics** tab, complete the form as follows:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group**: Choose Use existing and select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.

   - **Name**: Enter a unique name, such as `smartmeter-dps-SUFFIX`.

   - **Region**: Select the location you are using for this hands-on lab.

    ![The DPS creation form Basics tab is shown populated with the above values.](media/dps_basics_form.png "DPS Basics Tab")

4. Select **Review + create**, then once validation has passed, select **Create** once more to deploy the service.

5. When the DPS deployment is completed, select **Go to resource** on the deployment screen.

6. On the Overview screen of the Device Provisioning Service, copy and record the value for **ID Scope** for a future task.

    ![The DPS Overview screen displays with the ID Scope field highlighted.](media/dps_overview_essentials.png "DPS Overview screen.")

### Task 3: Link the IoT Hub to the Device Provisioning Service

1. Remaining in the DPS resource, select **Linked IoT hubs** from the left menu, located beneath the **Settings** heading. Then select **+Add** from the toolbar.

    ![The DPS Linked IoT hubs screen is shown with Linked IoT hubs selected in the left menu and the +Add button highlighted in the toolbar.](media/dps_linkediothubs_add_menu.png "DPS Linked IoT hubs")

2. In the Add link to IoT hub blade, populate the form as follows, then select **Save**:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **IoT Hub**: Select the `smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}` IoT Hub.
   - **Access Policy**: Select `iothubowner`.

    ![The Add link to IoT hub blade is shown populated with the preceding values.](media/dps_addlinktoiothub_form.png "Add link to IoT hub blade")

### Task 4: Create an enrollment group

Creating an enrollment group enables Fabrikam to allow devices to self-register. This avoids the need to register each device manually. Group enrollments are made possible via secure Attestations, these could be via certificates or symmetric keys. In this example, we will use the symmetric key approach. Using symmetric keys should only be used in non-production scenarios, such as with this proof of concept.

1. Remaining in the DPS resource, select **Manage enrollments** from the left menu, then select **+Add enrollment group** from the toolbar menu.

    ![The DPS Manage enrollments screen displays with the Manage enrollments item selected from the left menu and the +Add enrollment group button highlighted on the toolbar.](media/dps_manageenrollments_menu.png "DPS Add enrollment group")

2. In the Add Enrollment Group form, populate it as follows, then select the **Save** button.

    - **Group name**: Enter `smartmeter-device-group`.
    - **Attestation Type**: Select `Symmetric Key`.
    - **Auto-generate keys**: Checked.
    - **IoT Edge device**: Select `False`.
    - **Select how you want to assign devices to hubs**: Select `Evenly weighted distribution`.
    - **Select the IoT hubs this group can be assigned to**: Select `smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}.azure-devices.net`.
    - **Select how you want the device data to be handled on re-provisioning**: Select `Re-provision and migrate data`.
    - **Initial Device Twin State**: Retain the default value.
    - **Enable entry**: Select `Enable`.
  
   ![The Add Enrollment Group form is shown populated with the preceding values.](media/dps_addenrollmentgroup_form.png "Add Enrollment Group form")

3. Select the newly created enrollment group from the **Enrollment Groups** list.

4. On the Enrollment Group Details screen, copy the **Primary Key** value and record it for a future task.

    ![The Enrollment Group Details screen is shown with the copy button highlighted next to the Primary Key field.](media/dps_enrollmentgroup_primarykey.png "Enrollment Group Details")

## Exercise 2: Completing the Smart Meter Simulator

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam has left you a partially completed sample in the form of the Smart Meter Simulator solution. You will need to complete the missing lines of code that deal with device registration management and device telemetry transmission that communicate with your IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Implement device management with the IoT Hub

1. In **Visual Studio** on your **Lab VM**, use **Solution Explorer** to open the file `DeviceManager.cs`.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, choose **Task List**.

   ![On the Visual Studio View menu, Task List is selected.](media/visual-studio-view-menu-task-list.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

3. In the **Task List**, you will see a list of **TODO** tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed. Complete the line of code below each **TODO** using the code below as a reference. If your task list is blank, complete TODO steps 1-5 as indicated in the code in the next step.

    >**Note**: Sometimes the Task List will not populate, this will not impact completing this lab.

4. The following code represents the completed tasks in **DeviceManager.cs**:

   ```csharp

            {
                var globalEndpoint = "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net";
                SmartMeterDevice device = null;
                
                //TODO: 1. Derive a device key from a combination of the group enrollment key and the device id
                var primaryKey = ComputeDerivedSymmetricKey(enrollmentKey, deviceId);

                //TODO: 2. Create symmetric key with the generated primary key
                using (var security = new SecurityProviderSymmetricKey(deviceId, primaryKey, null))
                using (var transportHandler = new ProvisioningTransportHandlerMqtt())
                {
                    //TODO: 3. Create a Provisioning Device Client
                    var client = ProvisioningDeviceClient.Create(globalEndpoint, idScope, security, transportHandler);

                    //TODO: 4. Register the device using the symmetric key and MQTT
                    DeviceRegistrationResult result = await client.RegisterAsync();

                    //TODO: 5. Populate the device provisioning details
                    device = new SmartMeterDevice()
                    {
                        AuthenticationKey = primaryKey,
                        DeviceId = deviceId,
                        IoTHubHostName = result.AssignedHub
                    };
                }
                
                //return the device
                return device;
            }

                {
                    return enrollmentKey;
                }

                var key = "";
                using (var hmac = new HMACSHA256(Convert.FromBase64String(enrollmentKey)))
                {
                    key = Convert.ToBase64String(hmac.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(deviceId)));
                }

                return key;
            }
        }

    }
   ```

   >**Note**:  Be sure you only replace code in the **DeviceManager** class and not any other code in the file.

5. Save **DeviceManager.cs**.

### Task 2: Configure the DPS Group Enrollment Key and ID Scope

You will want to avoid entering the DPS Group Enrollment Key and ID Scope every time the project is run. To do this, you can set this value as the default text for the `DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key` and `DPS ID Scope` text boxes in the application. Follow these steps to configure the connection string:

1. Return to the **SmartMeterSimulator** solution in **Visual Studio** on your **Lab VM**.

2. In the **Solution Explorer**, expand the **SmartMeterSimulator** project and double-click **MainForm.cs** to open it. (If the Solution Explorer is not in the upper-right corner of your Visual Studio instance, you can find it under the View menu in Visual Studio.)

   ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, SmartMeterSimulator project is expanded, and under it, MainForm.cs is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-mainform-cs.png 'Visual Studio Solution Explorer')

    > **Note**: If the file does not open. One of the project files may be blocked.

   - Open **Windows Explorer** and navigate to the starter project folder: **C:\SmartMeter\Hands-on lab\lab-files\starter-project\SmartMeterSimulator**.
   - Right-click on the **MainForm.resx** file, then select **Properties**.
   - Check the **Unblock** checkbox on the bottom of the **General** tab, then select **Apply** then **OK**.

   ![Right-click MainForm.resx, go to Properties, then check the box next to Unblock](media/unblock-file.png 'Unblock file')

   - Close and reopen **Visual Studio**. Re-open the **MainForm.cs** file.

    >**Note**: If you are still unable to see the Windows Forms designer, close it, then right-click the project and select **Clean**. Then, right-click the project again and select **Build**. Now, you should be able to open the form without a problem.
    >
    >    ![Building and cleaning the solution to ensure that the Windows Forms editor shows up.](./media/build-and-clean-solution.png "Building and cleaning solution")
  
3. In the **Windows Forms designer surface**, select the **DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key** textbox.

   ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key textbox is highlighted, but is empty.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string.png 'Windows Form designer surface')

4. In the **Properties** panel, scroll until you see the **Text** property. Paste your **DPS Enrollment Group Primary Key** value copied from Exercise 1, Task 4, Step 4 into the value for the **Text** property. (If the properties window is not visible below the Solution Explorer, right-click the TextBox, and select **Properties**.)

   ![In the Properties panel, the Text property is highlighted, and is populated.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string-text-property.png 'Textbox properties')

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to populate the **DPS ID Scope** textbox with the value you recorded in Exercise 1, Task 2, Step 6.

6. Your DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key and ID Scope should now be present every time you run the **Smart Meter Simulator**.

   ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String now displays.](./media/smart-meter-simulator-iot-hub-connection-string-populated.png 'IoT Hub Connection String dialog')

7. Save **MainForm.cs**.

### Task 3: Implement the communication of telemetry with IoT Hub

1. Open **Sensor.cs** from the **Solution Explorer**, and complete the **TODO** items 6 to 11 as indicated within the code that are responsible for transmitting telemetry data to the IoT Hub, as well as receiving data from IoT Hub.

2. The following code shows the completed result:

   ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Text;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client;
    using Newtonsoft.Json;


    namespace SmartMeterSimulator
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// A sensor represents a Smart Meter in the simulator.
        /// </summary>
        class Sensor
        {
            private DeviceClient DeviceClient;
            private string IotHubUri { get; set; }
            public string DeviceId { get; set; }
            public string DeviceKey { get; set; }
            public DeviceState State { get; set; }
            public string StatusWindow { get; set; }
            public string ReceivedMessage { get; set; }
            public double? ReceivedTemperatureSetting { get; set; }
            public double CurrentTemperature
            {
                get
                {
                    double avgTemperature = 70;
                    Random rand = new Random();
                    double currentTemperature = avgTemperature + rand.Next(-6, 6);

                    if (ReceivedTemperatureSetting.HasValue)

12. Select **Save query**, and **Yes** when prompted with the confirmation.

    ![Save button on the Query blade is highlighted](./media/stream-analytics-job-query-save-2.png 'Query Save button')

13. Return to the **Overview** blade on your **Stream Analytics job** and select **Start**.

    ![The Start button is highlighted on the Overview blade.](./media/stream-analytics-job-start.png 'Overview blade start button')

14. In the **Start job** blade, select **Now** (the job will start processing messages from the current point in time onward).

    ![Now is selected on the Start job blade.](./media/stream-analytics-job-start-job.png 'Start job blade')

15. Select **Start**.

16. Allow your Stream Analytics Job a few minutes to start.

17. Once the Stream Analytics Job has successfully started, verify that you are showing a non-zero amount of **Input Events** on the **Monitoring** chart on the **Overview** blade. You may need to reconnect your devices on the **Smart Meter Simulator** and let it run for a while to see the events.

    ![The Stream Analytics job monitoring chart is diplayed with a non-zero amount of input events highlighted.](media/stream-analytics-job-monitoring-events.png 'Monitoring chart for Stream Analytics job')

### Task 3: Verify CSV files in blob storage

In this task, we are going to verify that the CSV file is being written to blob storage.

> **Note**: This can be done via Visual Studio or using the Azure portal. For this lab, we will perform the task using Visual Studio.

1. Within **Visual Studio** on your **Lab VM**, select the **View** menu, then select **Cloud Explorer**.

   ![On the Visual Studio View menu, Cloud Explorer is highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-menu-view-cloud-explorer.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

2. In **Cloud Explorer**, select **Account Management**, and connect to your Microsoft Azure Subscription.

   ![The Cloud Explorer window displays, and the Account management icon is highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-cloud-explorer-account-management.png 'Cloud Explorer Account Management')

3. If prompted, sign into your Azure account.

4. Allow Cloud Explorer about 30 seconds to load your subscription resources.

5. Expand your **Azure subscription**, then expand **Storage Accounts**, expand the **smartmetersSUFFIX** storage account, then expand the **Blob containers** node, then right-click the **smartmeters** container, and select **Open**. It may take a few moments to load your storage accounts.

   ![Storage accounts is expanded in the Visual Studio Cloud Explorer, with the smartmetersSUFFIX account is expanded, and the Open menu item highlighted for the smartmeters container.](media/visual-studio-cloud-explorer-storage-accounts.png 'Cloud Explorer Storage Accounts')

6. Verify files are being written to Blob storage (the files should be located underneath the **smartmeters** container).

   ![Files are listed in the blob storage account, as written by the cold path route in IoT Hub Messaging.](media/smart-meters-cold-path-files.png 'Smart meters files in blob storage')

### Task 4: Process with Spark SQL

In this task, you will create a new Databricks notebook to perform some processing and visualization of the cold path data using Spark.

> **Note**: The complete Databricks notebook can be found in the Databricks-notebook folder of the GitHub repo associated with this hands-on lab, should you need to reference it for troubleshooting.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the **Azure Databricks** resource you created in the [Before the hands-on lab setup guide](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Internet%20of%20Things.md) exercises, and select **Launch Workspace**.

   ![On the Azure Databricks Service blade, the Launch Workspace button is highlighted.](media/azure-databricks-launch-workspace.png 'Launch Azure Databricks Workspace')

2. On the **Azure Databricks** landing page, create a new notebook by selecting **New Notebook** under **Common Tasks**.

    ![The Azure Databricks landing page displays with New Notebook highlighted beneath the Common Tasks heading.](media/dbrix_commontasks_newnotebook.png "New Notebook")

3. In the **Create Notebook** dialog, enter `smartmeters` as the **Name** and select **Python** as the **Language**, then select **Create**.

   ![In the Create Notebook dialog, smartmeters is entered as the Name, and Python is selected in the Language drop down.](media/azure-databricks-create-notebook-dialog.png 'Create Notebook dialog')

    > **Note**: If your cluster is stopped, you can select the down arrow next to your attached cluster name, and select Start Cluster from the menu, then select Confirm when prompted.

4. In the **first cell** of your **Databricks notebook** (referred to as a paragraph in notebook jargon), enter the following **Python code** that creates widgets in the notebook for entering your **Azure storage account name** and **key**.

   ```python
   # Create widgets for storage account name and key
   dbutils.widgets.text("accountName", "", "Account Name")
   dbutils.widgets.text("accountKey", "", "Account Key")
   ```

    > **Note**:  Make sure to be aware of any indents\tabs. Python  treats indents\tabs with specific syntactical meaning.

5. Now, select the **Run** button on the right side of the cell and select **Run cell**.

   ![A cell in a Databricks Notebook is displayed, and the Run menu is visible with Run Cell highlighted in the menu.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-run-cell.png 'Datebricks Notebook run cell')

6. When the cell finishes executing, you will see the **Account Key** and **Account Name** widgets appear at the top of the notebook, just below the toolbar.

   ![In the Databricks notebook, Account Key and Account Name widgets are highlighted.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-widgets.png 'Databricks Notebooks widgets')

7. You will also notice a message at the bottom of the cell, indicating that the cell execution completed, and the amount of time it took.

   ![A message is displayed at the bottom of the cell indicating how long the command took to execute.](media/azure-databricks-cell-execution-time.png 'Cell execution time')

8. Enter your **Azure Storage account key** into the **Account Key widget text box**, and your **Azure storage account name** into the **Account Name widget text box**. These values can be obtained from the **Access keys** blade in your storage account.

    ![The Account Key and Account Name widgets are populated with values from the Azure storage account.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-widgets-populated.png 'Databricks Notebooks widgets')

9. At the bottom of the **first cell**, select the **+** button to insert a new cell below it.

    ![The Insert new cell button is highlighted at the bottom of the Databricks cell.](media/azure-databricks-insert-new-cell.png 'Insert new cell')

10. In the **new cell**, paste the following code that will assign the values you entered into the widgets you created above into variables that will be used throughout the notebook.

    ```python
    # Get values entered into widgets
    accountName = dbutils.widgets.get("accountName")
    accountKey = dbutils.widgets.get("accountKey")
    ```

11. Run the cell.

12. **Insert a new cell** into the notebook, and paste the following code to mount your blob storage account into Databricks File System (DBFS), then **run** the cell.

    ```python
    # Mount the blob storage account at /mnt/smartmeters. This assumes your container name is smartmeters, and you have a folder named smartmeters within that container, as specified in the exercises above.
    if not any(mount.mountPoint == '/mnt/smartmeters' for mount in dbutils.fs.mounts()): 
      dbutils.fs.mount(
      source = "wasbs://smartmeters@" + accountName + ".blob.core.windows.net/smartmeters",
      mount_point = "/mnt/smartmeters",
      extra_configs = {"fs.azure.account.key." + accountName + ".blob.core.windows.net": accountKey})
    ```

    > **Note**: Mounting Azure Blob storage directly to DBFS allows you to access files as if they were on the local file system. Once your blob storage account is mounted, you can access them with Databricks Utilities, `dbutils.fs` commands.

13. **Insert a new cell** and paste the code below to see how **dbutils.fs.ls** can be used to list the files and folders directly below the **smartmeters** folder.

    ```python
    # Inspect the file structure
    display(dbutils.fs.ls("/mnt/smartmeters/"))
    ```

14. **Run** the cell.

15. You know from inspecting the files in the storage container that the files are contained within a folder structure resembling, **smartmeters/YYYY-DD-MM/HH**. You can use wildcards to obfuscate the date and hour folders, as well as the file names, and access all the files in all the folders. **Insert another cell** into the notebook, paste the following code, and **run** the cell to load the data from the files in blob storage into a **Databricks Dataframe**.

    ```python
    # Create a Dataframe containing data from all the files in blob storage, regardless of the folder they are located within.
    df = spark.read.options(header='true', inferSchema='true').csv("dbfs:/mnt/smartmeters/*/*/*.csv",header=True)
    print(df.dtypes)
    ```

    > **Note**: In some rare cases, you may receive an error that the **dbfs:/mnt/smartmeters/\*/\*/\*.csv** path is incorrect. If this happens, change the path in the cell to the following: **dbfs:/mnt/smartmeters/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*.csv**

16. The cell above also outputs the value of the **df.dtypes** property, which is a list of the data types of the columns added to the **Dataframe**, similar to the following:

    ![Output from the df.dtypes property is displayed representing each column and type in the dataframe schema.](media/azure-databricks-df-dtypes-output.png 'Output from Dataframe dtypes')

    >**Note**: Do not worry if any of the time columns in the output are represented as `string`s, rather than `timestamp`s. It is simple to perform this cast if you need to. 

17. **Insert another cell** and run the following code to view the first 10 records contained in the **Dataframe**.

    ```python
    df.show(10)
    ```

18. Now, you can save the **Dataframe** to a **global table** in **Databricks**. This will make the table accessible to all users and clusters in your Databricks workspace. **Insert a new cell** and **run** the following code.

    ```python
    df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("SmartMeters")
    ```

19. Now, you will use the `%sql` magic command to change the language of the next cell to **SQL** from the notebook's default language, Python, then execute a SQL command to aggregate the SmartMeter data by average temperature. Paste the following code into **a new cell**, and **run** the cell.

    ```sql
    %sql
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(temp) AS averageTemp FROM SmartMeters GROUP BY id ORDER BY id
    ```

20. The output from the SQL command should resemble the following table:

    ![Output from executing a SQL statement a Databricks notebook cell using the %sql magic command.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-sql-magic-command.png 'SQL magic command')

21. Now, execute the same command in **a new cell**, this time using **Spark SQL** so you can save the summary data into a Dataframe. Copy and **execute** the following code into **a new cell**:

    ```python
    # Query the table to create a Dataframe containing the summary
    summary = spark.sql("SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(temp) AS averageTemp FROM SmartMeters GROUP BY id ORDER BY id")

    # Save the new pre-computed table
    summary.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("DeviceSummary")
    ```

22. Next, query from this summary table by **executing** the following query in **a new cell**:

    ```sql
    %sql
    SELECT * FROM DeviceSummary
    ```

23. **Below** the results table, notice the area to change the visualization for the tabular output. Expand the **Chart** menu and choose the **Bar** option.

    ![Buttons for displaying tabular results in different formats in Databricks](media/azure-databricks-notebook-visualizations.png 'Visualization options')

24. With the Bar chart visualization chosen, a **Plot Options..** button appears. Select **Plot Options..** and in the **Customize Plot** dialog, ensure the following are set:

    - **Keys**: **id**
    - **Values**: **averageTemp**
    - **Aggregation**: Select **AVG**.
    - Select **Grouped** as the chart type.
    - **Display type**: Select **Bar chart**.

      ![Plot customization options dialog in Azure databricks, with id in the Keys field, averageTemp in the Values field, Aggregation set to AVG, and the chart set to a grouped bar chart.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-customize-plot.png)

25. Select **Apply**.

26. Observe the results graphed as a column chart, where each column represents a device's average temperature.

    ![A bar chart is displayed, with devices on the X axis, and average temperatures on the Y axis.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-visualizations-bar-chart.png 'Bar chart')

## Exercise 5: Sending commands to the IoT devices

Duration: 20 minutes

Fabrikam would like to send commands to devices from the cloud in order to control their behavior. In this exercise, you will send commands that control the temperature settings of individual devices.

### Task 1: Add your IoT Hub connection string to the CloudToDevice console app

This console app is configured to connect to IoT Hub using the same connection string you use in the SmartMeterSimulator app. Messages are sent from the console app to IoT Hub, specifying a device by its ID, for example **Device1**. IoT Hub then transmits that message to the device when it is connected. This is called a **cloud-to-device message**. The console app is not directly connecting to the device and sending it the message. All messages flow through IoT Hub where the connections and device state are managed.

1. Return to the **SmartMeterSimulator** solution in **Visual Studio** on your **Lab VM**.

2. In the **Solution Explorer**, expand the **CloudToDevice** project and open **Program.cs**. (If the Solution Explorer is not in the upper-right corner of your Visual Studio instance, you can find it under the View menu in Visual Studio.)

    ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, CloudToDevice is expanded, and under it, Program.cs is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-program-cs.png 'Visual Studio Solution Explorer')

3. Replace **YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING** on line 13 with your IoT Hub connection string. This is the same string you added to the Main form in the SmartMeterSimulator earlier. The line you need to update looks like this:

    ```csharp
    static string connectionString = "YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING";
    ```

    After updating, your **Program.cs** file should look similar to the following:

    ![The Program.cs file has been updated with the code change.](media/visual-studio-program-cs.png 'Program.cs')

4. Save the file.

### Task 2: Send cloud-to-device messages

In this task, you will leave the simulator running and separately launch the console app to start sending cloud-to-device messages.

1. If you hover over one of the windows, you will see a dialog display information about the associated device, including the Device ID (in this case, **Device0**), Device Key, Temperature, and Indicator. The legend on the bottom shows the indicator displayed for each temperature range. The Device ID is important when sending cloud-to-device messages, as this is how we will target a specific device when we remotely set the desired temperature. Keep the Device ID values in mind when sending the messages in the next task.

    ![A dialog containing device information is displayed after hovering over a window.](media/smart-meter-simulator-device-info.png 'Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator')

2. Within the **SmartMeterSimulator** Visual Studio solution, right-click the **CloudToDevice** project, select **Debug**, then select **Start new instance** to run the console app.

3. In the **console window**, enter a **device number** when prompted. Accepted values are 0-9, since there are 10 devices whose IDs begin with 0. You can hover over the windows in the **Smart Meter Simulator** to view the Device IDs. When you enter a number, such as `0`, then a message will be sent to **Device0**. Be certain to select the device number of a registered window!

    ![The value of 0 is entered when prompted for the device number in the console window.](media/console-device-number.png 'Console App')

4. Now enter a **temperature value** between 65 and 85 degrees (F) when prompted. If you set a value above 72 degrees, the window will turn red. If the value is set between 68 and 72 degrees, it will turn green. Values below 68 degrees will turn the window blue. Once you set a value, the device will remain at that value until you set a new value, rather than randomly changing.

    ![A value of 70 has been entered for the temperature. A new log entry in the Smart Meter Simulator appears in yellow showing the message value of 70 sent to Device0.](media/console-temperature.png 'Console App and Smart Meter Simulator')

    If you run the **Smart Meter Simulator** side-by-side with the **console app**, you can observe the message logged by the Smart Meter Simulator within seconds. This message appears with a yellow background and displays the temperature request value sent to the device. In our case, we sent a request of 70 degrees to Device0. The console app indicates that it is sending the temperature request to the indicated device.

5. Hover over the device to which you sent the message. You will see that its temperature is set to the value you requested through the console app.

    ![Device0 is hovered over and the dialog appears showing the temperature set to the requested temperature.](media/smart-meter-simulator-set-temp.png 'Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator')

6. In the console window, you can enter `Y` to send another message. Experiment with setting the temperature on other devices and observe the results.

## Exercise 6: Implement an IoT Edge Gateway

Duration: 80 minutes

An IoT Edge Gateway device provides a connection between other devices on the network and the IoT Hub. Edge Gateway devices can be classified as a transparent or translation gateway.

In a transparent gateway scenario, the IoT Edge hub module itself acts as IoT Hub, it handles connections from other devices that have an identity with the same IoT hub. This type of gateway pattern is called transparent because messages pass from downstream devices to the IoT Hub as though there were not a gateway between them.

A translation gateway provides a connection to the IoT hub for devices that don't or can't connect to IoT Hub on their own, such as with devices that communicate over Bluetooth or Zigbee. This type of gateway pattern is called translation because the IoT Edge device has to perform processing on incoming device messages before they can be forwarded to the IoT Hub. These scenarios require additional modules on the IoT Edge gateway to handle the messaging protocol translation..

The transparent and translation gateway patterns are not mutually exclusive. A single IoT Edge device can function as both a transparent gateway and a translation gateway.

In one customer building, Fabrikam would like to establish a transparent IoT Edge Gateway to provide downstream device isolation and to deal with isolated internet outages. In this scenario, all communication from the building's IoT devices will be sent to IoT Hub via the gateway device, and when there is no internet connection, all telemetry will be held by the gateway device until connectivity is restored.

In this exercise, you will establish the LabVM as an IoT Edge transparent gateway and configure IoT devices to communicate through the gateway.

### Task 1: Provision the IoT Edge device with the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)

Earlier in the lab we provisioned smart meter devices at scale using an enrollment group with the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS). In this task, we will provision LabVM as an IoT Edge device using an individual enrollment. We will continue to use symmetric key attestation.

>**Note**: Device attestation using a TPM or X.509 certificates is more secure, and should be used for more stringent security requirements in production environments.

1. In the Azure Portal, open the lab resource group and select the **smartmeter-dps-{suffix}** device provisioning service resource.

2. From the left menu of the DPS, select **Manage enrollments**. Then, from the toolbar menu, select **+ Add individual enrollment**.

    ![The DPS resource screen displays with Manage enrollments selected from the left menu and the + Add individual enrollment menu item highlighted in the toolbar menu.](media/dps_individualenrollmentmenu.png "DPS add individual enrollment")

3. In the **Add Enrollment** form, populate the following values (leaving the rest as their defaults), then press **Save**.

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | Mechanism | Select **Symmetric Key**. |
    | Registration ID | Enter `edge-vm-{SUFFIX}`. |
    | IoT Edge device | Select **True** |

    ![The Add Enrollment form displays populated with the preceding values.](media/dps_individualenrollment_edgeform.png "Add Enrollment")

4. On the **Manage enrollments** screen, select the **Individual Enrollments** tab, then select the **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** registration entry.

    ![The Manage enrollments screen displays with the Individual Enrollments tab selected. The list of individual enrollments displays with edge-vm-{SUFFIX} selected.](media/dps_individualenrollments_list.png "Individual Enrollments")

5. On the edge-vm-{SUFFIX} Enrollment Details screen, copy and record the Primary Key value to a text editor.

    ![The edge-vm-{SUFFIX} Enrollment Details screen displays with the copy button highlighted next to the Primary Key value.](media/labvmenrollmentdetails.png "edge-vm-{SUFFIX} Enrollment Details")

### Task 2: Deploy a Linux server as an IoT Edge device

The IoT Edge runtime can be installed on various form factors, from small development boards like the Raspberry Pi to industrial-sized servers. Fabrikam desires to deploy a Linux Virtual Machine to serve as the IoT Edge Gateway device.

1. In the Azure Portal, open the lab resource group and select **+ Create** from the toolbar menu.

2. In the Search services and marketplace text box, enter and select `Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS` from the suggestion list. Then on the resource screen, select **Create**.

3. In the **Create a virtual machine** blade, fill the form as follows then select **Review + create**. Fields that are not specified can retain their default values.

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | Virtual machine name | Enter `edge-vm-{SUFFIX}`. |
    | Authentication type | Select **Password**. |
    | Username | Enter `demouser`. |
    | Password | Enter `Password.1!!`. |
    | Confirm password | Enter `Password.1!!`.|

    ![The Create a virtual machine form displays populated with the aforementioned values.](media/createedgevmblade.png "Create a virtual machine")

4. Once deployment has completed, open the newly deployed **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** resource and record the Public IP address value in a text editor.

    ![The Virtual machine overview is displayed with the Public IP address value highlighted.](media/ubuntuvm_publicipaddress.png "Virtual machine Overview")

5. To setup a host name for the IoT Edge device, select the **Not configured** link next to the **DNS name** field.

    ![The edge-vm screen displays with the Not configured link highlighted next to the DNS name label.](media/iotedge_hostnamenotconfigured.png "Host name not configured")

6. On the **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}-ip** Configuration screen, provide the DNS name label **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}**. It is important that this value matches the registration ID of the device in DPS. Select **Save**.

    ![The edge-vm-ip Configuration screen displays with the DNS label set to edge-vm-suffix and the save button is highlighted in the toolbar menu.](media/iotedge_sethostname_portal.png "edge-vm-ip Configuration")

7. Wait a few moments, then return to the **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** Overview screen and select **Refresh** from the toolbar menu. The DNS name value should now be populated with the label you assigned in the previous step.

   ![A portion of the edge-vm Overview screen displays with the DNS name value populated.](media/iotedge_dnsnamepopulated.png "Host name is configured")

8. In the upper right menu of the Azure Portal, open a cloud shell instance selecting **Bash** as the language of choice.

    ![The Azure Portal displays with the cloud shell icon highlighted in the top-right toolbar menu and Bash selected as the language.](media/cloudshell.png "Azure Portal Cloud Shell")

9. In the cloud shell, we will SSH into the virtual machine using the IP you recorded. At the Bash prompt, execute the following command, replacing {ipAddress} with the appropriate value.

    ```Bash
    ssh demouser@{ipAddress}
    ```

10. If prompted to trust the fingerprint, enter `yes`.

11. When prompted for a password, enter `Password.1!!`.

12. You are now connected to the virtual machine, you can tell by the prompt changing to **demouser@edge-vm-{SUFFIX}**. All commands executed will now be run on the virtual machine.

    ![The Bash prompt displays demouser@edge-vm-{SUFFIX}.](media/bash_demouserprompt.png "Bash prompt")

13. Install the Microsoft installation packages repository configuration by executing the following.

    ```Bash
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/multiarch/prod.list > ./microsoft-prod.list
    ```

14. Copy the generated list to the sources.list.d directory by issuing the following command.

    ```Bash
    sudo cp ./microsoft-prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
    ```

15. Install the Microsoft GPG public key.

    ```Bash
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
    ```

16. Copy the key to the trusted location by executing the following command.

    ```Bash
    sudo cp ./microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
    ```

17. Now that the Microsoft package feed has been added and trusted, update the device package list by executing the following command.

    ```Bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

18. Install the moby container engine by issuing the following command. When prompted to continue, enter `Y`. This container engine will be used to run IoT Edge modules in the form of Docker containers.

    ```Bash
    sudo apt-get install moby-engine
    ```

19. Install the IoT Edge runtime by executing the following command. When prompted to continue, enter `y`.

    ```Bash
    sudo apt-get install aziot-edge
    ```

20. Create a configuration file from a template that will contain the device identity and Device Provisioning Service information by executing the following command.

    ```Bash
    sudo cp /etc/aziot/config.toml.edge.template /etc/aziot/config.toml
    ```

21. Edit the newly created configuration file by issuing the following command.

    ```Bash
    sudo nano /etc/aziot/config.toml
    ```

22. Using the arrow keys on the keyboard, locate and uncomment the **hostname** variable. Set its value to the host name you assigned to edge-vm.

    ![A portion of the IoT Edge configuration file is open in nano where the hostname value is set accordingly.](media/iotedge_config_sethostname.png "IoT Edge configuration")

23. Keeping the configuration file open in nano, find the location of the DPS provisioning with symmetric key section. Uncomment and modify the id_scope, registration id (edge-vm), and symmetric_key (individual device enrollment primary key) values, then exit with saving the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then press enter).

    ![The IoT Edge configuration file is open in nano with the variables mentioned above replaced accordingly.](media/iotedge_dpsconfig.png "IoT Edge configuration")

24. Apply the configuration changes by executing the following command.

    ```Bash
    sudo iotedge config apply
    ```

25. Verify the installation by checking the status of the IoT Edge service.

    ```Bash
    sudo iotedge system status
    ```

26. Discover installed IoT Edge modules. The **edgeAgent** module should be listed with a status of **running**.

    ```Bash
    sudo iotedge list
    ```

    ![A Bash window displays with the sudo iotedge list command executed. The edgeAgent module displays as running.](media/iotedge_edgelist_agentrunning.png "IoT Edge module listing")

27. In the Azure Portal, open the lab resource group and select the **smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}** IoT Hub. Verify the IoT Edge device successfully registered through the DPS by selecting **IoT Edge** from the left menu and finding **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** in the listing.

    ![The IoT Hub screen displays with IoT Edge selected from the left menu and edge-vm highlighted in the IoT Edge Devices listing.](media/iothub_edgevm.png "Azure IoT Edge Devices Listing")

28. In order for downstream devices to communicate with the IoT Edge Gateway using the AMQP protocol, port 5671 needs to be opened in the Ubuntu firewall. Open port 5671 by executing the following command in the cloud shell.

    ```Bash
    sudo ufw allow 5671
    ```

29. Keep the cloud shell window open and connected to the edge-vm via ssh for the next task.

30. In the Azure Portal, open the lab resource group and select the **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}-nsg** Network security group.

31. From the left menu, select **Inbound security rules**, then **+ Add**.

    ![The edge-vm-nsg resource screen displays with Inbound security rules selected from the left menu and the + Add button highlighted in the toolbar menu.](media/nsg_inbound_addmenu.png "Inbound network security rules")

    ![The Add inbound security rule blade displays populated with the aforementioned values.](media/addinboundruleform.png "Add inbound security rule")

### Task 3: Generate test certificates for downstream device connectivity

It is a requirement that downstream devices authenticate to the [IoT Edge Gateway using certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-create-transparent-gateway). In this task, you will create test certificates and ensure proper authentication between downstream devices and the gateway device.

1. The Azure/iotedge GitHub project contains scripts to generate non-production certificates. Clone the repository by executing the following command:

   ```Bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure/iotedge.git
   ```

2. Create a directory to hold the necessary certificates.

    ```Bash
    mkdir certificates
    ```

3. Move to the new directory.

    ```Bash
    cd certificates
    ```

4. Copy the necessary scripts from the GitHub repository.

    ```Bash
    cp ../iotedge/tools/CACertificates/*.cnf .
    ```

    then

    ```Bash
    cp ../iotedge/tools/CACertificates/certGen.sh .
    ```

5. Leverage the helper script to generate the root CA certificate and one intermediate certificate.

   ```Bash
   ./certGen.sh create_root_and_intermediate
   ```

6. Leverage the helper script to create the IoT Edge device CA certificate.

   ```Bash
   ./certGen.sh create_edge_device_ca_certificate "edgevmca"
   ```

7. Once more we will edit the IoT Edge configuration to configure the generated certificates.

    ```Bash
    sudo nano /etc/aziot/config.toml
    ```

8. Locate the **trust_bundle_cert** parameter, uncomment and set the value as follows.

    ```Bash
    trust_bundle_cert = "file:///home/demouser/certificates/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem"
    ```

9. Continuing in the same file, locate the **\[edge_ca\]** section, uncomment and replace the values as follows, then save and exit while saving the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then press enter):

    ```Bash
    [edge_ca]
    cert: "file:///home/demouser/certificates/certs/iot-edge-device-ca-edgevmca-full-chain.cert.pem"
    pk: "file:///home/demouser/certificates/private/iot-edge-device-ca-edgevmca.key.pem"
    ```

10. Apply the configuration changes by executing the following command.

    ```Bash
    sudo iotedge config apply
    ```

11. Exit the SSH session by executing the following command:

    ```Bash
    exit
    ```

12. Next, create a **certificates** directory and download the IoT Edge certificates to the cloud shell storage.

    ```Bash
    mkdir ~/certificates
    ```

    Followed by the secure copy command (replacing {edgeVMIp} with the IP address of the IoT Edge device):

    ```Bash
     scp -r -p demouser@{edgeVmIp}:~/certificates ~/certificates
    ```

    You will be prompted for the password: `Password.1!!`.

13. Download the root certificate to a known location by selecting the **Upload/Download files** button on the cloud shell toolbar menu, and choosing **Download** from the expanded menu options.

    ![The cloud shell toolbar displays with the Upload/Download files button highlighted.](media/cloudshell_downloaduploadbutton.png "Cloud shell toolbar")

14. In the **Download a file** dialog, set the path to the following value, this will download the file from the browser. We will be using this file later on in this lab.

    ```Bash
    /certificates/certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem
    ```

### Task 4: Configure the IoT Edge Device as a Gateway in IoT Hub

To configure edge-vm as an IoT Edge Gateway the $edgeHub IoT Edge module needs to be configured by having its routing defined. The route defined will be setup to forward all downstream device messages to IoT Hub. IoT Edge modules can be configured and deployed to devices via the IoT Hub.

1. In the Azure Portal, open the lab resource group and select the **smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}** IoT Hub resource.

2. From the left menu, select **IoT Edge**, then select **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** from the list of devices. Notice that the IoT Edge Runtime response indicates the deployment configuration is not set, and the $edgeHub module is not running - this will soon change.

3. On the **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** screen, select **Set modules** from the top toolbar menu.

    ![The edge-vm screen displays with the Set modules button highlighted in the toolbar menu.](media/iotedge_setmodules.png "Set IoT Edge modules")

4. On the **Set modules on device: edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** screen, select the **Routes** tab and establish the following route. Once complete, select **Review + Create**, then **Create** on the review screen.

   | Route Name | Route Value | Description |
   |------------|-------------|-------------|
   | allDownstreamToIoTHub |FROM /messages/* WHERE NOT IS_DEFINED ($connectionModuleId) INTO $upstream | When a message is received from a downstream device, the $connectionModuleId value is blank. The $connectionModuleId value is only set on messages originating from other IoT Edge modules. This route value filters all messages and forwards on those originating from downstream devices. |

    ![The Set Modules screen displays with the Routes tab selected and the preceding route.](media/iotedge_setmodules_routes.png "IoT Edge Routes")

5. Wait a few moments and refresh the **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** screen. Note that the IoT Edge Runtime Response now displays **200 -- OK** and the $edgeHub module is now running (you may need to refresh a few times to see the $edgeHub module running successfully).

    ![The edge-vm screen displays with the IoT Edge Runtime Response displaying a status of 200 and the $edgeHub module displays as running.](media/iotedge_runtime200_edgehubrunning.png "edge-vm status")

### Task 5: Update the device client to communicate through the IoT Edge Gateway

Individual downstream device clients need to be configured to communicate directly through the IoT Edge Gateway device rather than to the IoT Hub directly. In this task, the meters located in the second (right) building of the simulator will be configured to send telemetry through the IoT Edge transparent gateway. These are Devices 7, 8, and 9.

1. In the Azure Portal, open the lab resource group and locate and select the **smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}** IoT Hub.

2. From the left menu, select **IoT devices**.

3. From the list of IoT devices, select **Device7**.

   ![The smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX} IoT devices screen displays with IoT devices selected in the left menu and Device7 highlighted in the list of devices.](media/iotdevices_list_device7.png "IoT devices list")

4. Assign **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** as the parent device. This will allow this device to communicate through the IoT Edge transparent gateway. Select the cog icon next to the **Parent device** field.

    ![The IoT device screen displays with the cog icon selected next to the Parent device field label.](media/device_setparentdevice_cog.png "IoT device details")

5. On the **Set an IoT Edge device as parent device** screen, select **edge-vm-{SUFFIX}** from the listing, then select **OK**.

    ![The Set an IoT Edge device as parent device screen displays with edge-vm-{SUFFIX} selected and the OK button is highlighted.](media/iotedge_setparent_selection.png "IoT Edge parent device selection")

6. Select **Save** on the IoT Device screen to commit the changes.

    ![The IoT device screen displays with the Save button selected in the toolbar menu. The populated Parent device field is highlighted.](media/iothub_devicescreen_save.png "Save IoT device settings")

7. Repeat steps 1-6 for **Device8** and **Device9**.

8. In Visual Studio, open the **Sensor.cs** file from within the SmartMeterSimulator.

9. Locate the line **//TODO: 6. Connect the Device to Iot Hub by creating an instance of DeviceClient** and add the gateway hostname as the second parameter. This parameter will route all messages to the IoT Edge Gateway.

    ![A code snippet displays with the IoT Edge Gateway hostname string value highlighted.](media/deviceconnectiontogatewayip.png "IoT Edge Gateway connectivity")

10. Locate **//TODO: 12 - Install and trust IoT Edge Gateway root certificate** in the DeviceManager.cs file and replace it with the following listing. This code will trust the root certificate of the IoT Edge gateway device. Replace {CERTPATH} with the full path to the certificate you downloaded from the cloud shell earlier. This method is called every time the application is run (MainForm.cs in the MainForm constructor).

    ```C#
    //TODO: 12 - Install and trust IoT Edge Gateway root certificate
    string trustedCACertPath = @"{CERTPATH}";
    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(trustedCACertPath))
    {
        if (!File.Exists(trustedCACertPath))
        {
            // cannot proceed further without a proper cert file                    
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Invalid certificate file.");
        }
        else
        {
            X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.Root, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
            store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadWrite);
            store.Add(new X509Certificate2(X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(trustedCACertPath)));
            store.Close();
        }
    }
    ```

11. Run the application, select all three windows in the second building (on the right in the simulator) and choose **Register**. Once the windows display as cyan, select the **Connect** button for the devices to start sending telemetry through the IoT Edge Gateway.

    ![The Smart Meter Simulator displays with multiple smart meters sending telemetry."](media/smartmetersim_registerandconnect.png "Smart Meter Simulator")

    >**Note**: You may be prompted to install the IoT Edge Gateway certificate, select **Yes** if this occurs.

    ![A Security Warning dialog displays regarding installation of a certificate.](media/osinstallcertificate.png "Security Warning dialog")

12. Now it's time to verify telemetry is being sent to IoT Hub. In Visual Studio, expand the **View** menu and choose **Cloud Explorer**.

13. Expand the subscription being used for this lab, and expand the **IoT Hubs** node. Right-click on **smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}** to display the context menu and select the **Start Monitoring Built-in Event Endpoint** item.

    ![The Cloud Explorer displays with a subscription expanded along with the IoT Hubs node. The smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX} has its context menu expanded with the Start Monitoring Built-in Event Endpoint item selected.](media/cloudexplorer_iothubcontextmenu.png "Monitor Built-in Event Endpoint")

14. The **Output** panel will start displaying IoT Hub events including telemetry events.

    ![The Output pane displays with incoming telemetry events.](media/output_iothubevents.png "IoT Hub Output")
